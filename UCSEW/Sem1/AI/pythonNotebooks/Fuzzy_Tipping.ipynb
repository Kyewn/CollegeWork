    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a fuzzy control system which models how you might choose to tip\n",
    "at a restaurant.  When tipping, you consider the service and food quality,\n",
    "rated between 0 and 10.  You use this to leave a tip of between 0 and 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would formulate this problem as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Antecednets (Inputs)\n",
    "   - `service`\n",
    "      * Universe (ie, crisp value range): How good was the service of the wait\n",
    "        staff, on a scale of 0 to 10?\n",
    "      * Fuzzy set (ie, fuzzy value range): poor, acceptable, amazing\n",
    "   - `food quality`\n",
    "      * Universe: How tasty was the food, on a scale of 0 to 10?\n",
    "      * Fuzzy set: bad, decent, great\n",
    "* Consequents (Outputs)\n",
    "   - `tip`\n",
    "      * Universe: How much should we tip, on a scale of 0% to 25%\n",
    "      * Fuzzy set: low, medium, high\n",
    "* Rules\n",
    "   - IF the *service* was good  *or* the *food quality* was good,\n",
    "     THEN the tip will be high.\n",
    "   - IF the *service* was average, THEN the tip will be medium.\n",
    "   - IF the *service* was poor *and* the *food quality* was poor\n",
    "     THEN the tip will be low.\n",
    "* Usage\n",
    "   - If I tell this controller that I rated:\n",
    "      * the service as 9.8, and\n",
    "      * the quality as 6.5,\n",
    "   - it would recommend I leave:\n",
    "      * a 20.2% tip.\n",
